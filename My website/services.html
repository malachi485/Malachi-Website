						<p>I have been making beats since 2021. My beats have cam along way. I made soundtracks for short movies. I aspire to get paid 15-30$ per beat. Beats are my craft and I get in my own world when I make them. This is a talent that I have and I am willing to get paid for this.</p>

						<p> I really have an interest for photography. Everytime I go somewhere or out of town I always take photos. The photo above me was the photo I took when I went to Atlanta last year. I am going to get a camera soon and I usually take photos on my Iphone. I really want to get paid for this hourly. My rates are 50$ an hour. This is a skill and I am willing to get paid for it</p>
